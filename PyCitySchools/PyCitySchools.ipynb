    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary of Analysis**\n",
    "  This analysis delves into raw data sourced from two main datasets based on student and school statistics. It looks into student performance broken down into certain metrics, such as average test scores, passing percentages, and overall performance and are weighed against additional factors including school size, spending per student, school type (charter vs district). Extrapolating this information can provide a broader picture and deeper trends and patterns emerge from within these datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "    - Despite having a lower average per-student budget, charter schools demonstrate far greater student performance versus their district school counterparts.\n",
    "    - Larger schools (2000+ students) tend to have lower overall performance versus smaller schools, indicating that school size may impact individual student results.\n",
